# Project Report: AI Language Tutor

## 1. Project Overview

**AI Language Tutor** is an Android application designed to facilitate the learning of Chinese (Mandarin) through the power of Artificial Intelligence. The app provides interactive tools for learners to improve their grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. It leverages Google's **Gemini AI** to deliver real-time feedback, making language learning more accessible and personalized.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack
*   **Platform**: Android
*   **Programming Language**: Java
*   **Minimum SDK Version**: 24 (Android 7.0 Nougat)
*   **Compile SDK Version**: 36 (Android 15)
*   **Build System**: Gradle
*   **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API (via `generativeai` SDK)
*   **Network Client**: OkHttp (for API communication)
*   **Concurrency**: Guava (ListenableFutures) & Java Executors

### 2.2 Key Libraries & Dependencies
*   **Android Jetpack Components**:
    *   `androidx.appcompat:appcompat`: For modern UI compatibility.
    *   `androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout`: For responsive and complex layouts.
    *   `androidx.cardview:cardview`: For material design cards.
    *   `com.google.android.material:material`: For implementing Material Design 3 guidelines.
*   **AI Integration**:
    *   `com.google.ai.client.generativeai:generativeai`: Official SDK for accessing Gemini models.
*   **Utilities**:
    *   `com.google.guava:guava`: Used for handling asynchronous AI responses.

## 3. Features Implemented

### 3.1 Grammar Correction (Core Feature)
*   **Functionality**: Allows users to input Chinese sentences to check for grammatical errors.
*   **AI Logic**: Uses the `gemini-1.5-flash` model to analyze text.
*   **Output**: The AI identifies specific mistakes and provides a corrected version of the sentence along with an explanation.
*   **UI/UX**: Features a clean input area, a "Check Grammar" button with loading states, and a result card that displays the AI's feedback.

### 3.2 User Interface (UI)
*   **Design Language**: Modern Material Design with a teal and white color scheme.
*   **Screens**:
    *   **Login/Signup**: Secure authentication flow with email/password and Google sign-in options.
    *   **Home Dashboard**: Central hub displaying daily streaks, goals, and quick access to learning modules (Grammar, Vocabulary, Pronunciation).
    *   **Activity Layouts**: Responsive `ConstraintLayout` implementations ensuring compatibility across various device sizes.

## 4. Development Challenges & Solutions

### 4.1 AI Model Integration
*   **Challenge**: Initial integration with `gemini-1.5-flash` faced "404 Model Not Found" errors due to API key restrictions and endpoint version mismatches.
*   **Solution**: Switched to the specific model version `gemini-1.5-flash-001` (and later back to `1.5-flash` with a verified key) and ensured the API key had no application restrictions during the testing phase. Implemented robust error handling to display raw API errors for easier debugging.

### 4.2 Dependency Management
*   **Challenge**: Conflicts with newer AndroidX libraries (`androidx.activity`) requiring a higher `compileSdk`.
*   **Solution**: Updated the project's `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` to version 36 to satisfy library requirements.

### 4.3 XML Layout Malformations
*   **Challenge**: Several layout files (`activity_home.xml`, `activity_grammar_correction.xml`) contained unclosed tags, causing build failures with hundreds of resource errors.
*   **Solution**: Systematically analyzed and repaired the XML structure of all affected files, ensuring valid syntax.

## 5. Future Scope
*   **Pronunciation Assessment**: Integrating speech-to-text to analyze user pronunciation against native speakers.
*   **Vocabulary Builder**: Creating dynamic flashcards generated by AI based on the user's proficiency level.
*   **Progress Tracking**: Implementing local database storage (Room) to save user progress and history.

## 6. Conclusion
The **AI Language Tutor** app successfully demonstrates the integration of Generative AI into a mobile learning environment. By providing instant, intelligent feedback on grammar, it addresses a key pain point in language acquisition—the lack of immediate correction. The project is built on a solid, modern Android architecture that is scalable for future feature additions.
